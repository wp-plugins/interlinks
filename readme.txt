Wikistyle links in your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

Create internal Wiki-style links in your WordPress blog. Easy to use and once you've started you won't be able to live without it. Simply put [[ and ]] around a post title and it will link to the post in your blog. Also supports [[Post Title|This is a link to a post]] style tags.

This newest version fixes a bug with apostrophes in post titles. It also allows the more complicated linking style.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `hq-interlinks.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use it? =

Simply put [[ and ]] around a post title within your post or excerpt and Interlinks will turn it into a link for you. You can also use the more advanced wiki style [[Post Title|This is a link to a post]]. If a link is red then the page doesn't exist.

= Where can I get more information? =

From the plugins page on http://www.harleyquine.com.

== Screenshots ==

1. Automatic ad placement locations.
2. The config page.
3. The author advertising user page.

== Upgrading ==

Simply delete the old one, upload and activate. Note that the file name has changed so delete kd_interlinks.php and upload hq-interlinks.php.
