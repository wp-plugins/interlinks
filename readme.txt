Wikistyle links in your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

Create internal Wiki-style links in your WordPress blog. Easy to use and once you've started you won't be able to live without it. Simply put [[ and ]] around a post title and it will link to the post in your blog. Also supports [[Post Title|This is a link to a post]] style tags.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `hq-interlinks.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or automatically install from the dashboard.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress Dashboard.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use it? =

Simply put [[ and ]] around a post title within your post or excerpt and Interlinks will turn it into a link for you. You can also use the more advanced wiki style [[Post Title|This is a link to a post]]. If a link is red then the page doesn't exist.
